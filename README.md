# Gregory's Timed JavaScript Code Quiz

## Description

I am pleased to bring you the completed version of my application. This application is a timed quiz that has a variety of questions to test your knowledge on a few JavaScript topics. I made this quiz because I found that I understood JavaScript concepts, however when asked a question about it I would hesitate and have to think about my answer for a second. Being under a time limit has helped my hone in my confidence when talking about JavaScript, and I am confident it can do the same for you! Throughout the making of this web application, I found myself stuck at many points, and through intensive research I was able to find a solution and overcome this issue. One of those issues was that I was unsure how/where to nest my list of questions within the code. I found the solution, and it was to put them on a seperate file.js (see questions.js). Prior to this, as I am new to the world of coding, I did not know that I could have multiple files.js on the same project.

## Installation

There is no istallation required to use this application, as it is a web based application. All one needs is access to the internet.

(Tip: make sure that your browser is up to date with its newest version, as this may cause loading issues)

## Usage

To use this application, simply click on the URL (), and the user will be taken to the main page (see Screenshot 1 below). Once there, the user will click on the "Start Quiz" button to initiate the quiz. Once the quiz has been initiated, the first question will appear and the timer will immediately begin to count down from 100 (as seen in Screenshot 2 below). The user will answer each question as they appear, and for every question answered incorrectly the user will lose 20 "points" or seconds off of their time. After answering each question the user will be presented with their final score (see Screenshot 3 below). The final score will be the amount of time remaining, less 20 for each question answered incorrectly. If the user answers every question correctly, their final score will simply be 100 minus however many seconds it took them to complete the quiz. The user can then enter their initals to be added to the highscores. If the user wishes to take the quiz again, simply refresh the page.
